''Sample Call
''The folowing is a sample for how to start the timer when Outlook starts. The interval is set to 60,000 ms, that is the TimerEvent procedure will be called after 60 seconds. In that event procedure you can disable the timer if you just need that one call. Or keep the timer running if you need regular calls every 60 seconds.
''
''In any case, before Outlook terminates at the latest you must disable the timer else Outlook would crash. Calling DisableTimer from within Application_Quit as shown is sufficient.
